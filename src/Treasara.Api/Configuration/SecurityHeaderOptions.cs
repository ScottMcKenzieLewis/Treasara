/// <remarks>
/// This configuration allows removal of headers that may expose sensitive information
/// about the server implementation, framework versions, or technology stack. Removing
/// such headers is a security best practice that helps reduce the attack surface by
/// preventing information disclosure to potential attackers.

    /// <remarks>
    /// Removing headers like "Server" and "X-Powered-By" prevents attackers from easily
    /// identifying the web server technology and framework versions, making it more difficult
    /// to target known vulnerabilities. This is part of a defense-in-depth security strategy.
